**Overview of the Analysis**


**Results**
After completing the Pyber analysis in Jupyter notebook, the following table of results was obtained:

As demonstrated in the table, the highest number of Pyber rides occurred in urban areas, and the least occurred in rural areas.  A pie chart displaying the proportion of rides in each city type is shown below:

In addition, the number of drivers in each city type can be seen below.  A large majority of Pyber drivers work in urban areas (81%), while only 2.6% of drivers work in rural areas.

From the table and line graph, we can conclude that the highest number of drivers, rides, and fares are found in urban areas.  However, urban areas have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  The average fare per ride is 1.4 times higher in rural areas than in urban areas, and average fare per driver is 3.3 times higher in rural areas than urban areas.
