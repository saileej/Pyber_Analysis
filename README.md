# Pyber_Analysis

**Overview of the Analysis**


**Results**
After completing the Pyber analysis in Matplotlib and Jupyter notebook, the following table of results was obtained:

From the table, we can conclude that the highest number of drivers, rides, and fares are found in urban areas.  However, urban areas have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  The average fare per ride is 1.4 times higher in rural areas than in urban areas, and average fare per driver is 3.3 times higher in rural areas than urban areas.  

In addition, as shown in the pie chart below, a large majority of Pyber drivers work in urban areas (81%), while only 2.6% of drivers work in rural areas:

Lastly, the line graph demonstrates that Pyber is most successful in urban areas, then suburban areas, then rural areas.  From January - April of 2019, total daily urban fares were consistently $2000+, while total daily suburban fares were generally between $800 and $1500.  Lastly, total daily rural fares were generally lower than $500.

**Summary**
Based on the analysis, Pyber may consider offering incentives for drivers to work in suburban or rural areas.  Since only 19% of Pyber drivers currently work in these areas (with less than 3% working in rural areas), suburban and rural passengers may not be able to find a ride at the right time and ultimately may not use Pyber.  Therefore, incentivizing more drivers to work in non-urban areas may increase the total number of suburban/rural rides and fares.

In addition, there are ~1.5 times more urban drivers than urban rides completed.  This means that some urban drivers have not completed a single ride, and are likely not earning income.  Again, encouraging drivers (possibly financially) to work in non-urban areas would alleviate this problem as well.

Lastly, since the majority of rides and fare is from urban passengers, Pyber may consider charging more in urban areas to maximize profits.
